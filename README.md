# Simplecs

Simplecs is a Component-Entity-System game engine used to write games in a modular fashion.
It was inspired by a
[blog post by Chris Granger](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/12/11/anatomy-of-a-knockout/)
(also see [Gambit](https://github.com/ibdknox/gambit)). To learn more about Component-Entity-System
engines (also called entity systems or component systems), see
[this series of posts](http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/).

The library is at a very early stage and is subject to change.


## Usage

Add the following dependency in your `project.clj`:

``` clojure
[simplecs "0.1.0"]
```

There is a [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md).
